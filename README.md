# TicTacToe-195
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game I created using Visual Studio.  It is a WPF application written in C#.  The first player uses the 'X' character and the second player uses 'O'.
Player 1 clicks on a square to place their piece.  Then the second player will click to add theirs.  Once a win condition is met of 3 consecutive pieces of the same type,
or the board is full, the game will end and the user can click anywhere on the board to start again.
